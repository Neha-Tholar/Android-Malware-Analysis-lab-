# Android-Malware-Analysis-lab
The Android Malware Analysis lab development project is to provide an open-source based free platform for analyzing Android-based malware. The analysis process is supported through dynamic and static tools along with an emulator which aids the simulation of the Android device. MobSF is the tool used and functions along with Android SDK to conduct dynamic tests in a sandboxed environment of malware files. The features of the lab image file are portability, customizability, flexibility, and accessibility. Portability provides the provision of being able to move it to a different cloud or host it on a local virtual machine. The flexibility attribute highlights dynamic memory provisioning and expands the malware samples available. Customization provisions additional installation of tools. Accessibility permits a user to access the image through different methods. The malware samples part of this lab is made available through Androzoo. The targeted audience for the project is students or entry-level malware analysts. The lab provides an easy way to study malware analysis in a safe and structured setup accompanied by easy-to-use manuals.
